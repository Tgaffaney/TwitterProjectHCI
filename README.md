# TwitterProjectHCI

## Description

This is a website that lets you see the sentiment for different keywords found in tweets.  You type in a word and the website calculates the sentiments as tweets roll in across the US.  Sentiment is displayed by showing states as green where the sentiment is more positive, and red where sentiment is more negative.  This was specifically interesting to use for keywords that are political in nature and seeing the different states have different sentiment.
